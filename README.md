wanted to try making a personal website, so here it is.

i have a png mockup design in the folder thats quite hastily mspainted, but overall it's pretty straightforward
not really familiar too too much with frontend development so this is a chance for me to learn this stuff.

using SASS for the styling (koala is what i'm using to compile it), and D3 eventually for the visualizations
