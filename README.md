wanted to try making a personal portfolio website, so here it is.
i have some experience with d3 and frontend dev from my internships, but i wanted to do an actual full project and see what i was capable of.

currently not done, main layout somewhat figured out and put together. i used the van de graaf canon for book layouts to guide my spacing, and fontflame for some preliminary font work.

using SASS for the styling (koala is what i'm using to compile it), and D3 for various SVG work.

# todo
